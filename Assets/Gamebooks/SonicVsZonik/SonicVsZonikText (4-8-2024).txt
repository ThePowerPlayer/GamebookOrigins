They were usually his friends! He'd tried to speak to them, but all they kept shouting at him was something about him filling all their burrows with rotten eggs. Sonic didn't even like eggs, and the bunnies were his mates, so he'd never dream of doing that to them. Suddenly, everything had gone black... Sonic could see stars, not the kind of stars in the night sky, but the kind that whizz around the inside of your head. It was as if the whole of the universe was circling around him â€” Sonic, of course, being the centre of the universe.\n\n'Hey, slow down, it was day-time a minute ago!'\n\nSuddenly, his senses returned and he jumped to his feet. The bunnies were gone. He was alone, confused and not sure what was going on.\n\n'Wow, this is weird,' says Sonic.\n\nSonic might be covered in spines, but they don't protect his head. Gingerly, he raises a paw to the rapidly growing bruise.\n\n'Oh no! It's the size of an egg ... hey, now don't say egg! Bad vibes about that word. I suppose I'd better find out whether the bunnies were right.'\n\nSonic set out through the Green Hills, still not really believing what had happened in the past ten minutes. Everything looked normal, the hills were green, the sky was blue. Yes, this had to be the Green Hill Zone. But there was something, something odd, nagging him.\n\n'ZZZZzzzzwing!'\n\nA small silver object flew towards Sonic's head, embedding itself in a tree behind him. Sonic turned around to take a look at the tree. There, half-buried in the bark, was the familiar shape of a Buzzer.\n\n'ZZZzzz ... buzzzz! Get ya next time. Buzzz!' threatened the Buzzer, rather pathetically, as he was firmly stuck in the tree.\n\nSonic smiled, all was well in the Green Hill Zone. They always try to get me, he thought, but never manage it. The thought formed a smile. Sonic started walking away from the cursing Buzzer, wondering whether to head for the hills or one of the bridges. Imagine you are Sonic - what would you do? Go to the hills (turn to <b>106</b>)? If you think Sonic should head towards the river, then turn to <b>177</b>.";
