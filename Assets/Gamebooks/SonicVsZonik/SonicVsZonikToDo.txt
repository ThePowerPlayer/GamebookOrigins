As of May 3, 2024, here are the remaining things to do during development of Sonic Gamebook Origins, (roughly) in order:
(When you're done with a task, add a ✓ in between the brackets.)

[✓] Make dice rolls without abilities or Tails sections work properly
[] Make dice rolls with Tails sections work properly
[] Make dice rolls with two dice at the same time work properly
[] Prevent the Back button from being pressed during a dice roll
[] Make dice roll on section 31 work properly (dice roll + 7)
[] Implement all sections with a single dice roll
[] Implement Sections 35 and 138 (two dice rolls in a row)
[] Allow the player to customize Sonic's Vital Statistics in the Menu scene
[] Fix issues with back button moving player to incorrect sections (perhaps using a queue to store history isn't best)
[] Implement sections where player can or must return to a previous section (211, 288, 25, 237, 187)
[] Implement getting hit (lose all rings or a life if you have no rings)
[] Implement earning rings
[] Implement fights against enemies
[] Implement fights where the player can choose Sonic's ability to use
[] Implement adding things to Sonic's stuff
[] Implement sections with choices that require an item from Sonic's Stuff
[] Implement the Zone Chip
[] Import all images of artwork from Sonic vs. Zonik
[] Make artwork images appear in their proper sections
[] For infinite loop between sections 216, 114, 85, 68, and 114, implement a break in the space-time continuum (allow a jump to section 227)
[] Add an Options menu, with toggles for the following features:
	[] (Global) Back button
	[] (Global) Make visited sections yellow
	[] (Global) Turn-to-section input field
	[] (Sonic vs. Zonik) Fix Section 60 not being accessible
	[] (Sonic vs. Zonik) Fix infinite loop between sections 216, 114, 85, 68, and 114
	[] (Sonic vs. Zonik) Fix sudden jump from Section 153 to 268 (go to Section 158 instead)
	[] (Sonic vs. Zonik) Fix Section 180 (Whiffy liquid) taking player to Section 76 (go directly to Section 191 instead)
	[] (Sonic vs. Zonik) Fix choice at Section 82 (Rexon encounter) taking player to Section 67 (go directly to Section 121 instead)
	[] (Sonic vs. Zonik) Fix Section 84 (fruit machine) going straight to Section 97 (go to Section 66 instead)
[] Add autosaving capabilities (Make the game write to a file every time a section is visited. In the file, store visited sections and chosen options. Load the file every time the game is started.) 
[] Add an improved background
[] Use a different font (try a white font with a black outline)
[] Add sound effects
[] Add fitting music for different parts of the game
[] Improve the title screen
[] Improve the menu screen
[] Add a credits section
[] Add a speedrun mode with a timer
[] Add a results screen after Section 300 with remaining lives, rings, and speedrun timer (if applicable)
[] Make the first test build of the game (see what it looks like on a standard 16:9 monitor screen)
